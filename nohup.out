Several Republican presidential campaigns began mapping out new demands Sunday for greater control over the format and content of primary debates, which have attracted big audiences and become strategically critical for the 2016 cycle’s expansive field of contenders.

The effort was a response to long-simmering frustrations over the debates, the questions and in some cases the moderators, which boiled over this weekend when advisers from at least 11 campaigns met in the Washington suburbs to deliberate about how to regain sway over the process.

The private gathering became the latest twist in what has been a turbulent season of debates for the GOP, with less-popular candidates — including a sitting senator and governor — furious about being relegated to a little-watched “undercard” debate and the front-runners dismayed by a system they have described as a disastrous brew of bias and arbitrary rules.

The meeting also exposed a leadership rift that has widened in recent days between the Republican National Committee, which negotiated the debate schedule and formats, and some of the candidates. RNC officials said they would not participate in Sunday’s meeting, but they have been reassuring campaign operatives that they are willing to recalibrate the events.

Shortly before the meeting began, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus announced a staff shake-up within the GOP that appeared intended to calm the unhappiness of the presidential campaigns.

[RNC shakes up staff to calm unhappy campaigns]

The stakes are high, coming just days before the fourth Republican presidential debate and as the record-setting audiences continue to exert immense influence over the race. Former Texas governor Rick Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker left the race after underwhelming debate appearances, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush has seen his campaign rocked by a poorly reviewed performance last week during the CNBC debate in Colorado.

Hillary Rodham Clinton’s effective turn at the first Democratic primary debate last month only intensified the need for Republicans to coalesce and improve their party’s public image. With donors and activists watching the debates closely to see who is most aligned with grass-roots conservatives, they are also assessing who is best positioned for a general-election matchup. That has left Republican candidates clamoring for more airtime — and taking out their anger on the networks they believe are giving them short shrift.

GOP campaign operatives began arriving at the Hilton Alexandria Old Town at around 5:30 p.m. Sunday and headed upstairs to what had been code-named “family dinner.”

As the meeting got underway, senior strategists from several presidential campaigns revealed in e-mails and text messages that Priebus’s staff shake-up was not enough. One campaign manager, speaking about the private meeting on the condition of anonymity, wrote: “Major question is if the RNC should be involved at all.”

The campaigns reached an early consensus on one issue, according to several operatives in the room: the secure standing of Fox News Channel. Any changes would be applied to debates after next week’s Fox Business Network debate. Among the reasons, according to one operative in the room, was that “people are afraid to make Roger [Ailes] mad,” a reference to the network’s chief.

Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz recommended that Telemundo be reinstated after being dropped along with NBC. But the campaign of businessman Donald Trump, represented by manager Corey Lewandowski, threatened to boycott a debate if the Spanish-language network that Trump has clashed with was granted one.

Representatives from the undercard campaigns of Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told reporters that they would focus on what Graham adviser Brett O’Donnell called “equal treatment” for their campaigns — two debates, each with seven randomly selected candidates.

Ben Carson’s campaign manager, Barry Bennett, was hopeful that the group could agree on one two-hour debate with every candidate onstage.

“Of course,
 we’re not going to get five-minute opening statements,” Bennett said, but “you can do a lot in two hours.”

Some tension was already in the air about that idea. Several campaigns, including Trump’s, were more interested in reducing the number of candidates on the stage.

“One of the big goals is allowing for more substance and equal time,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the campaign manager for her father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. “It does make that difficult if there are multiple candidates but the debate’s capped at two hours.”

Carson advisers have also proposed airing the debates on the Internet rather than on television.

As they left the hotel, Republican aides said reporters should expect the campaigns to release a joint letter addressed to the television networks by Tuesday. It will list what the campaigns want for the upcoming debates and was agreed to before the meeting ended. Campaigns will have Monday to review it a final time and formally sign off.

Carson and Trump, two GOP polling leaders who got relatively little time at the CNBC debate, kick-started the idea for a strategy session late last week in a series of phone calls between their top advisers. Others quickly jumped on board.

Bush’s team still feels shortchanged not only about how much airtime he was given but also about the way the network described him to viewers. According to Republicans close to the Bush operation, his on-screen biography listed his work as a banker rather than his record as governor. Bush’s advisers have groused that the RNC should have done a better job alerting the campaigns about the broadcast and letting the candidates shape their biographical details.

“The last debate was kind of ridiculous,” Bush told reporters in Iowa on Saturday. “I say this somewhat in jest: At least there was someone who fared worse in the last debate than me — CNBC.”

[In Iowa, a humbled Jeb Bush pledges to be a better candidate]

CNBC’s status as a totem of media bias grew all weekend, as much of the Republican field descended on Iowa. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), whose jeremiad against the press was seen as a defining moment of the debate, told conservatives at one stop that Sean Hannity, Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh — conservative radio hosts with different styles and huge audiences — should be called in to moderate.

Several candidates also weighed in on the Sunday-morning talk-show circuit.

“As far as I’m concerned, these debates are to highlight the differences in philosophy between the candidates, particularly when you have as many candidates as we have now,” Carson said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We need to tighten it up a little bit and do it more like a professional type of debate.”

Ohio Gov. John Kasich said candidates do not have enough time to explain their positions during debates. He said he preferred a setting in which candidates could answer “a lot of questions over a period of time where I could actually explain myself, instead of having to go so quickly to take on complex issues in short periods of time.”

“I know that Harry Truman couldn’t get elected president explaining the United States’ health-care plan in 30 seconds,” Kasich said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Former Silicon Valley executive Carly Fiorina, whose agility as a debater has lifted her candidacy, said that the political leanings of moderators should come under more scrutiny.

“When you don’t have a single conservative moderator, when the moderation earns boos from the audience — I mean, I’ve never seen that before where an audience booed the moderation,” she said on “This Week.”

mourned the 224 victims of a charter flight that crashed over the weekend on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, investigators on Sunday began the difficult process of trying to determine whether the plane, which they said had broken up in midair, was brought down by an act of terrorism or a tragic accident.

After surveying the wreckage scattered across eight square miles of the barren, black pebbles of the Sinai Desert plateau, Viktor Sorochenko, the director of the Interstate Aviation Commission, told journalists that the wide dispersion meant that the plane had disintegrated before the pieces fell to earth.

But that alone did not indicate any specific cause for the crash, he said, describing the debris field as a giant ellipse. “It is too soon to talk about conclusions,” he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. “The collapse occurred in midair, and the wreckage is scattered over a vast area.”

The circumstances of the crash kept alive the possibilities that mechanical failure or terrorism might have caused the catastrophe. Either appeared plausible to aviation experts.

One former French accident investigator, Alain Bouillard, said he could think of no plausible scenario in which a mechanical problem could have led to a midair breakup at cruising altitude of a modern aircraft like the Airbus A321-200 that crashed in Sinai.

“A rupture in flight after a technical fault seems to me highly improbable,” he added.

But Mark Rosenker, a former chairman of the United States National Transportation Safety Board, said he thought the crash was more likely to be an accident than terrorism and noted that the plane had been damaged in 2001 when its tail struck the runway upon landing in Cairo. (At the time, the plane was operated by Middle East Airlines, a Lebanese carrier.) But he said that he could not rule out terrorism as a possible cause.

United States government officials said on Sunday they remained skeptical that terrorism was involved, and instead focused on indications of some sort of mechanical failure. Information extracted from the black boxes, which have already been recovered, was likely to yield further clues as to what happened.

Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, said on Sunday that the investigation could take months and that his government had no plans to issue frequent updates about its progress.

“We do not want to jump ahead of events and talk because even that takes away from our credibility,” he said during a speech to Egyptian military officials.

In St. Petersburg on Sunday, an endless stream of the bereaved, many of whom knew none of the victims, filed past an impromptu shrine outside Pulkovo Airport, tearfully leaving flowers and stuffed animals in tribute to the dead. Thousands more attended a candlelight vigil in the windy, early darkness of fall outside the city’s famed Winter Palace.

Flags were lowered to half-staff throughout the country, and Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church reflected the somber mood in a sermon expressing compassion for the victims of Russia’s worst air disaster.

“Two hundred twenty-four people, mainly young and healthy, including children, happy on the way back from a holiday — they were probably chatting merrily, recalling their vacation,” he said during his sermon Sunday in Moscow, according to Interfax. “Everything was cut tragically short.”

Russian charter airlines have a dismal safety record, while a violent Islamic insurgency has long plagued the northern Sinai Peninsula where the plane crashed. Its fighters possess at least short-range, shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles, although not the type that can blast an airplane near a cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.

Russia’s military entered the Syrian civil war on the side of the government a month ago, with around 50 aircraft bombing targets of virtually all the groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, including the Islamic State. That prompted Islamic extremists to call for jihad against Russia, and its law enforcement agencies have claimed to break up several terrorist plots.

The flight recorders from the 18-year-old Airbus A321-200 were in good enough condition to decipher, Maxim Sokolov, Russia’s minister of transportation, said Sunday before leaving Egypt to return home, but that work had not yet begun. He had earlier rejected speculation that terrorism was a possible explanation for the crash as “fabrications.”

The Islamic State’s Sinai branch, which had released a statement claiming responsibility for bringing down the Russian airplane within hours of the crash, did not provide any further evidence to support its claim on Sunday.

The group has released photographs or videos after large-scale attacks, showing the assaults or profiles of the attackers to prove its claims. In the past, the Islamic State has also issued false statements of responsibility in Egypt.

Analysts have said that it was unlikely that militants could have shot down the plane, though they have left open the possibility of a bomb or some other sabotage.

The Air Arabia, Emirates and FlyDubai airlines on Sunday joined Air France-KLM and Lufthansa in announcing that flights would be rerouted around the Sinai Peninsula as a precaution, until the risk of a surface-to-air missile attack could be ruled out.

What We Know So Far

    224 people died, mostly young Russian families on vacation.
    The crash was said to be the worst in Russia's aviation history.
    The wide distribution of debris, over eight square miles, indicated the plane had broken up in the air.
    The plane was operated by Kogalymavia, a private company that flies under the name Metrojet.
    Authorities are considering mechanical failure and terrorism as causes.
    The Islamic State in the Sinai claimed responsibility, but is not known to possess surface-to-air missiles.
    Some airlines are now rerouting flights to avoid the Sinai Peninsula.

Paul Hayes, director of Ascend Worldwide, a British aviation consultancy, said a midair breakup did not rule out mechanical faults or pilot error as a cause, while also leaving open the possibility of terrorism.

“Airplanes have broken up as a result of sabotage or a bomb on board, and also during efforts to recover that overstressed the airframe,” he said, referring to a pilot’s efforts to recover from a stall or spin at a high speed. “The breakup could have occurred during an out-of-control descent.”

Experts and other commentators in Russia leaned heavily toward mechanical explanations, not a stretch given the dismal safety record of the country’s airline industry.

The wife of the co-pilot of the Airbus told Russia’s NTV channel that her husband had complained about the mechanical condition of the plane, operated by Kogalymavia, a private company flying planes under the name Metrojet. The woman, Natalya Trukhacheva, told the station that her husband had said before the flight that the “technical condition of the airplane left much to be desired.”

Yulia Latynina, a columnist for Novaya Gazeta, wrote that the basic conclusion to be drawn from the crash was that the Russian aviation industry was in disarray and that the government was to blame for not clearing it up. “Some simple advice: Do not ever fly on Russian charter flights,” she wrote.

Alexander Fridland, an expert from the Russian Institute for Civilian Aviation Research, told the RBC newspaper that the reason could have been troubles with the electric system, a fire on board or possibly an explosion in the hold. He discounted engine trouble. “If something is wrong, the crew won’t take off,” he said. “They are not suicidal, after all.”

Other experts noted that an engine fire should not prove fatal, that the plane could fly on one engine or even none, and that it would have plenty of time to radio to ground control that it was in trouble.

The sudden dive and radio silence prompted some to conclude that the Islamic State was responsible, taking revenge for the military campaign that President Vladimir V. Putin began in Syria a month ago.

Among the mourners at the St. Petersburg airport shrine, Sergei Kubar blamed terrorists. “When Putin started to bomb Syria, I said we could expect something like this,” he said.

Discussion forums on television devoted some time to discussing the possibility of terrorism, but the news programs on state-run television and the country’s more high-profile commentators largely avoided the question. News reports only mentioned the Islamic State claim in passing, dismissing it quickly.

Other issues prompted much more of a discussion. First, the reaction in Ukraine, home to three of the victims. The crash prompted an outpouring of sympathy, with flowers and condolence notes placed outside the Russian Embassy in Kiev.

Russian-backed separatists are believed to have used a surface-to-air missile to bring down a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 flying over Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Russia has strenuously denied any connection to the tragedy.

In Egypt, search crews had transferred 163 bodies from the site to Cairo hospitals and morgues by Sunday. Most of them were to be flown back to St. Petersburg overnight, the Egyptian government said in a statement.

Uploaded: shit mourned the 224 victims of a charter flight that crashed over the weekend on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, investigators on Sunday began the difficult process of trying to determine whether the plane, which they said had broken up in midair, was brought down by an act of terrorism or a tragic accident.

After surveying the wreckage scattered across eight square miles of the barren, black pebbles of the Sinai Desert plateau, Viktor Sorochenko, the director of the Interstate Aviation Commission, told journalists that the wide dispersion meant that the plane had disintegrated before the pieces fell to earth.

But that alone did not indicate any specific cause for the crash, he said, describing the debris field as a giant ellipse. “It is too soon to talk about conclusions,” he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. “The collapse occurred in midair, and the wreckage is scattered over a vast area.”

The circumstances of the crash kept alive the possibilities that mechanical failure or terrorism might have caused the catastrophe. Either appeared plausible to aviation experts.

One former French accident investigator, Alain Bouillard, said he could think of no plausible scenario in which a mechanical problem could have led to a midair breakup at cruising altitude of a modern aircraft like the Airbus A321-200 that crashed in Sinai.

“A rupture in flight after a technical fault seems to me highly improbable,” he added.

But Mark Rosenker, a former chairman of the United States National Transportation Safety Board, said he thought the crash was more likely to be an accident than terrorism and noted that the plane had been damaged in 2001 when its tail struck the runway upon landing in Cairo. (At the time, the plane was operated by Middle East Airlines, a Lebanese carrier.) But he said that he could not rule out terrorism as a possible cause.

United States government officials said on Sunday they remained skeptical that terrorism was involved, and instead focused on indications of some sort of mechanical failure. Information extracted from the black boxes, which have already been recovered, was likely to yield further clues as to what happened.

Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, said on Sunday that the investigation could take months and that his government had no plans to issue frequent updates about its progress.

“We do not want to jump ahead of events and talk because even that takes away from our credibility,” he said during a speech to Egyptian military officials.

In St. Petersburg on Sunday, an endless stream of the bereaved, many of whom knew none of the victims, filed past an impromptu shrine outside Pulkovo Airport, tearfully leaving flowers and stuffed animals in tribute to the dead. Thousands more attended a candlelight vigil in the windy, early darkness of fall outside the city’s famed Winter Palace.

Flags were lowered to half-staff throughout the country, and Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church reflected the somber mood in a sermon expressing compassion for the victims of Russia’s worst air disaster.

“Two hundred twenty-four people, mainly young and healthy, including children, happy on the way back from a holiday — they were probably chatting merrily, recalling their vacation,” he said during his sermon Sunday in Moscow, according to Interfax. “Everything was cut tragically short.”

Russian charter airlines have a dismal safety record, while a violent Islamic insurgency has long plagued the northern Sinai Peninsula where the plane crashed. Its fighters possess at least short-range, shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles, although not the type that can blast an airplane near a cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.

Russia’s military entered the Syrian civil war on the side of the government a month ago, with around 50 aircraft bombing targets of virtually all the groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, including the Islamic State. That prompted Islamic extremists to call for jihad against Russia, and its law enforcement agencies have claimed to break up several terrorist plots.

The flight recorders from the 18-year-old Airbus A321-200 were in good enough condition to decipher, Maxim Sokolov, Russia’s minister of transportation, said Sunday before leaving Egypt to return home, but that work had not yet begun. He had earlier rejected speculation that terrorism was a possible explanation for the crash as “fabrications.”

The Islamic State’s Sinai branch, which had released a statement claiming responsibility for bringing down the Russian airplane within hours of the crash, did not provide any further evidence to support its claim on Sunday.

The group has released photographs or videos after large-scale attacks, showing the assaults or profiles of the attackers to prove its claims. In the past, the Islamic State has also issued false statements of responsibility in Egypt.

Analysts have said that it was unlikely that militants could have shot down the plane, though they have left open the possibility of a bomb or some other sabotage.

The Air Arabia, Emirates and FlyDubai airlines on Sunday joined Air France-KLM and Lufthansa in announcing that flights would be rerouted around the Sinai Peninsula as a precaution, until the risk of a surface-to-air missile attack could be ruled out.

What We Know So Far

    224 people died, mostly young Russian families on vacation.
    The crash was said to be the worst in Russia's aviation history.
    The wide distribution of debris, over eight square miles, indicated the plane had broken up in the air.
    The plane was operated by Kogalymavia, a private company that flies under the name Metrojet.
    Authorities are considering mechanical failure and terrorism as causes.
    The Islamic State in the Sinai claimed responsibility, but is not known to possess surface-to-air missiles.
    Some airlines are now rerouting flights to avoid the Sinai Peninsula.

Paul Hayes, director of Ascend Worldwide, a British aviation consultancy, said a midair breakup did not rule out mechanical faults or pilot error as a cause, while also leaving open the possibility of terrorism.

“Airplanes have broken up as a result of sabotage or a bomb on board, and also during efforts to recover that overstressed the airframe,” he said, referring to a pilot’s efforts to recover from a stall or spin at a high speed. “The breakup could have occurred during an out-of-control descent.”

Experts and other commentators in Russia leaned heavily toward mechanical explanations, not a stretch given the dismal safety record of the country’s airline industry.

The wife of the co-pilot of the Airbus told Russia’s NTV channel that her husband had complained about the mechanical condition of the plane, operated by Kogalymavia, a private company flying planes under the name Metrojet. The woman, Natalya Trukhacheva, told the station that her husband had said before the flight that the “technical condition of the airplane left much to be desired.”

Yulia Latynina, a columnist for Novaya Gazeta, wrote that the basic conclusion to be drawn from the crash was that the Russian aviation industry was in disarray and that the government was to blame for not clearing it up. “Some simple advice: Do not ever fly on Russian charter flights,” she wrote.

Alexander Fridland, an expert from the Russian Institute for Civilian Aviation Research, told the RBC newspaper that the reason could have been troubles with the electric system, a fire on board or possibly an explosion in the hold. He discounted engine trouble. “If something is wrong, the crew won’t take off,” he said. “They are not suicidal, after all.”

Other experts noted that an engine fire should not prove fatal, that the plane could fly on one engine or even none, and that it would have plenty of time to radio to ground control that it was in trouble.

The sudden dive and radio silence prompted some to conclude that the Islamic State was responsible, taking revenge for the military campaign that President Vladimir V. Putin began in Syria a month ago.

Among the mourners at the St. Petersburg airport shrine, Sergei Kubar blamed terrorists. “When Putin started to bomb Syria, I said we could expect something like this,” he said.

Discussion forums on television devoted some time to discussing the possibility of terrorism, but the news programs on state-run television and the country’s more high-profile commentators largely avoided the question. News reports only mentioned the Islamic State claim in passing, dismissing it quickly.

Other issues prompted much more of a discussion. First, the reaction in Ukraine, home to three of the victims. The crash prompted an outpouring of sympathy, with flowers and condolence notes placed outside the Russian Embassy in Kiev.

Egypt's Ministry of Civil Aviation has released a photo of a flight data recorder from downed Kogalymavia Flight 9268 as part of the investigation into Saturday's crash over the Sinai Peninsula.

Russian investigators have determined the data recorders, or "black boxes," are in good condition, the state-run TASS news agency reported earlier.

The only reasonable explanation for the crash of a Russian passenger jet in Egypt is "an external influence," an executive from the airline that operated the flight said Monday, stressing that planes don't just break apart in midair.

Kogalymavia Flight 9268 broke into pieces before it hit the ground in a remote area of Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula on Saturday, killing all 224 people on board.

The executive was not specific about what he meant by an external influence. Experts say it is too early to know for certain what caused the plane to break up at the start of what could be a lengthy investigation.

"We exclude technical problems and reject human error," Alexander Smirnov, a Kogalymavia airline official, said at a Moscow news conference as he discussed possible causes of the crash.

He added that the crew did not issue any warnings or communications during the final moments, indicating that the flight crew must have been disabled and not able to radio out.

However, Smirnov said that while the plane's flight and voice data recorders had been recovered, they had not been read or decoded.

Officials have played down an apparent claim by Islamic militants in Sinai that they brought down the Airbus A321-200, saying technical failure is the most likely reason for the crash.

Here's where things stand:

THE FLIGHT
Flight 9268 was on its way from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg early Saturday when it dropped off radar about 23 minutes into the flight, Egyptian officials say.


Air traffic controllers apparently didn't receive any distress calls from the pilots. "There was nothing abnormal before the plane crash," Egyptian Civil Aviation Minister Hossam Kamel said Saturday. "It suddenly disappeared from the radar."

CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said it was "unusual" for an aircraft to go down roughly 20 minutes into a flight.

"At this point, a plane is on autopilot. It's reaching its initial cruising altitude, and there is little that can or should go wrong," he wrote in an analysis.

But the website Flightradar24, which tracks aircraft around the world, said it had received data from the Russian plane suggesting sharp changes in altitude and a dramatic decrease in ground speed before the signal was lost.

"It's disturbing to me. It indicates to me that something occurred possibly in the way of aerodynamic stall. I mean, an airplane just cannot fly at those lower speeds," said CNN aviation analyst Les Abend, although he cautioned that the Flightradar information was very preliminary.

THE CRASH
"Disintegration of the fuselage took place in the air, and the fragments are scattered around a large area" covering about 20 square kilometers (8 square miles), Viktor Sorochenko, executive director of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, told reporters Sunday.

Learning that the plane broke into pieces while in the air helps reduce the list of possible causes of the crash, but there are still plenty of scenarios, said CNN aviation analyst Peter Goelz.

"It narrows it down a little bit, but there are a number of issues that could have affected this plane," said Goelz, a former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB. "And terrorism has not been ruled out."

He suggested the disaster could have resulted from "some sort of catastrophic failure, perha

"It narrows it down a little bit, but there are a number of issues that could have affected this plane," said Goelz, a former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB. "And terrorism has not been ruled out."

He suggested the disaster could have resulted from "some sort of catastrophic failure, perha
ps caused by an earlier maintenance problem. It could have been a center fuel tank that might have exploded."

Former NTSB investigator Alan Diehl told CNN he believes the "final destruction" of the plane could have been from "aerodynamic forces or some other type of G-forces."

Investigators are expected to get a clearer idea of what happened to the aircraft from its flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- devices commonly known as black boxes -- both of which have been recovered, according to authorities.

THE PLANE
The Airbus A321-200 operated by the airline Kogalymavia passed a routine inspection before takeoff, Egyptian Airports Co. chief Adel Al-Mahjoob said Saturday.

According to the Aviation Safety Network, which tracks aircraft incidents, the same plane's tail struck a runway while landing in Cairo in 2001 and required repair. At the time, the aircraft was registered to the Lebanese carrier Middle East Airlines, registration records show.

Kogalymavia's Andrei Averyanov confirmed to reporters Monday that the plane had been damaged in 2001 but said it had most recently been thoroughly checked for cracks in 2013. Not enough time had passed for major cracks to develop to a critical size since then, he said.

The ex-wife of the plane's copilot, Sergei Trukhachev, said over the weekend that he had told his daughter he was concerned about the condition of the plane. "Our daughter had a telephone chat with him just before the flight," Natalya Trukhacheva told Russia's state-run NTV. "He complained before the flight that one could wish for better technical condition of the plane."

But a Kogalymavia said such reports were irresponsible and that there was no record of the pilot or crew making any complaints.

Executive Smirnov said that he had personally flown the plane in recent months and that it was "pristine."

The A321-200 was built in 1997, and Kogalymavia, which is also known as Metrojet, had been operating it since 2012, Airbus said in a statement. The aircraft had clocked around 56,000 flight hours over the course of nearly 21,000 flights, the plane maker said.

THE VICTIMS
There were 217 passengers and seven crew members on board Flight 9268. Of the passengers, 209 were Russian, four were Ukrainian and one was Belarussian. The citizenships of three other passengers are unknown.

Russian media reported that the disaster created a large number of orphans in Russia, as a lot of parents left their young children with relatives while they took vacations in Sharm el-Sheikh.

Early Monday, a Russian plane carrying the remains of 144 of the crash victims landed in St. Petersburg, Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported.

Another plane bringing more bodies is expected to depart Egypt later Monday.

THE INVESTIGATION
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Sunday urged the public not to jump to conclusions. "These are complicated matters that require advanced technologies and wide investigations that might go on for months," he said.

Al-Sisi has promised Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow "the broadest possible participation of Russian experts in the investigation," according to the Kremlin, and Russian officials have joined their Egyptian counterparts at the crash scene. Putin has also ordered Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to open an investigation into the crash, the Kremlin said.

Aviation investigators from France and Germany, the countries where the plane was manufactured, are also taking part in the inquiry.

Egyptian officials said Saturday that the two "black boxes" were being transported to Cairo for analysis.

The flight data recorder stores a vast array of information about the flight, such as air speed, altitude, engine performance and wing positions. The cockpit voice recorder captures sounds on the flight deck that can include conversations between the pilots and warning noises from the aircraft.

Russia's state-run official TASS news agency reported Monday that the "black boxes" had been inspected by top Russian officials and were said to be in a good condition.

THE REGION
In recent years, the Sinai Peninsula has been a battleground between ISIS-affiliated militants and Egyptian security forces. The vicious conflict has killed hundreds of people.

The militants appeared to claim responsibility for bringing down the Russian passenger jet in a statement posted online Saturday, but officials in Egypt and Russia disputed it.

Mahjoob, the airport official, said there was no evidence of a terrorist attack. And Russian Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said the claim that terrorists brought down the plane with an anti-aircraft missile "cannot be considered reliable," according to RIA Novosti.

The Egyptian military said militants in Sinai have shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons that shoot only as high as 14,000 feet, far short of the more than 30,000 feet at which Flight 9268 was flying when it dropped off radar.

To reach such an altitude would require missiles using special launch pads and radar systems operated by engineers, the military said.

Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov refused to discount terrorism, telling CNN's Matthew Chance on Monday that "only (the) investigation can rule out something."

Kogalymavia executives also said Monday that it was too early in the investigation to speculate or draw any conclusions. But Smirnov referred to purported footage of the crash posted by militants, saying: "Those images you have seen on the Internet, I think they are fake."

The only reasonable explanation for the crash of a Russian passenger jet in Egypt is "an external influence," an executive from the airline that operated the flight said Monday, stressing that planes don't just break apart in midair.

Kogalymavia Flight 9268 broke into pieces before it hit the ground in a remote area of Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula on Saturday, killing all 224 people on board.

The executive was not specific about what he meant by an external influence. Experts say it is too early to know for certain what caused the plane to break up at the start of what could be a lengthy investigation.

"We exclude technical problems and reject human error," Alexander Smirnov, a Kogalymavia airline official, said at a Moscow news conference as he discussed possible causes of the crash.

He added that the crew did not issue any warnings or communications during the final moments, indicating that the flight crew must have been disabled and not able to radio out.

However, Smirnov said that while the plane's flight and voice data recorders had been recovered, they had not been read or decoded.

Officials have played down an apparent claim by Islamic militants in Sinai that they brought down the Airbus A321-200, saying technical failure is the most likely reason for the crash.

Here's where things stand:

THE FLIGHT
Flight 9268 was on its way from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg early Saturday when it dropped off radar about 23 minutes into the flight, Egyptian officials say.


Air traffic controllers apparently didn't receive any distress calls from the pilots. "There was nothing abnormal before the plane crash," Egyptian Civil Aviation Minister Hossam Kamel said Saturday. "It suddenly disappeared from the radar."

CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said it was "unusual" for an aircraft to go down roughly 20 minutes into a flight.

"At this point, a plane is on autopilot. It's reaching its initial cruising altitude, and there is little that can or should go wrong," he wrote in an analysis.

But the website Flightradar24, which tracks aircraft around the world, said it had received data from the Russian plane suggesting sharp changes in altitude and a dramatic decrease in ground speed before the signal was lost.

"It's disturbing to me. It indicates to me that something occurred possibly in the way of aerodynamic stall. I mean, an airplane just cannot fly at those lower speeds," said CNN aviation analyst Les Abend, although he cautioned that the Flightradar information was very preliminary.

THE CRASH
"Disintegration of the fuselage took place in the air, and the fragments are scattered around a large area" covering about 20 square kilometers (8 square miles), Viktor Sorochenko, executive director of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, told reporters Sunday.

Learning that the plane broke into pieces while in the air helps reduce the list of possible causes of the crash, but there are still plenty of scenarios, said CNN aviation analyst Peter Goelz.

"It narrows it down a little bit, but there are a number of issues that could have affected this plane," said Goelz, a former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB. "And terrorism has not been ruled out."
